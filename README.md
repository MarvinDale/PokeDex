# PokeDex

https://my-pokedex-application.herokuapp.com/

This is a website where you can search for any pokemon from the pokemon games. You can search using the name of the pokemon or choose to have a random pokemon displayed.

The pokemon are retrieved using the PokeAPI and displayed on the webpage (if their artwork is in the database).

The backend was written using Node.js and the frontend was styled using bootstrap.
